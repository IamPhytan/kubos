Getting Started with KubOS and the Kubos SDK
============================================

This tutorial guides the user through the process of creating a new Kubos project using Python2.7
and installing and running it on a target OBC.

.. note:: 

    The iOBC does not support Python. If this is the board which you are using,
    please refer to the :doc:`Using Rust with the Kubos SDK <../sdk-docs/sdk-rust>`
    doc to get your first project built and running on the OBC

Prerequisites
-------------

- :doc:`Install the Kubos SDK <../installation-docs/sdk-installing>`
- Have an OBC available with both Python and SSH capabilities
  (preferably with an :doc:`installation of Kubos Linux <../installation-docs/index>`)

    - :ref:`Configuring Ethernet <ethernet>`

Creating your Project
---------------------

Like all good programming tutorials, we'll start with a basic "Hello, World" program.

Log into your SDK VM and then create a new folder for your project.

Within that folder, create a new file, ``hello_world.py``, which will print "Hello, World!"
and then exit.

.. code-block:: python

    print "Hello, World!"

Running the Project Locally
---------------------------

The Kubos SDK should have all resources required to run the project locally.

Our example project can be run like so::

    $ python hello_world.py
    Hello, World!
    
Logging in to KubOS
-------------------

By default, KubOS comes with a user account, ``kubos``, with the default password ``Kubos123``.

Log into your OBC using SSH and its configured IP address. Enter the password when prompted.

For example::

    $ ssh kubos@10.0.2.20
    kubos@10.0.2.20's password: ********

If this is your first time connecting to the board via SSH, you may be prompted to confirm
the target IP's authenticity. Enter "yes" if this occurs::

    $ ssh root@10.0.2.20
    The authenticity of host '10.0.2.20 (10.0.2.20)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ir2TC+iML+MJ5Cb3cxTReWI69aX6EtPysFQzWleKc+8.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '10.0.2.20' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    kubos@10.0.2.20's password: ********

Please confirm that you are able to connect to the board via SSH from the SDK before proceeding
with the next step.

Transferring the Project to a Target OBC
----------------------------------------

We can now transfer the project to the ``kubos`` user home directory on the target OBC using SCP::

    $ scp hello_world.py kubos@10.0.2.20:/home/kubos
    kubos@10.0.2.20's password: ********
    hello_world.py                                       100%   21     0.0KB/s   00:00
    
Running the Project on the Target OBC
-------------------------------------

Once the project has been transferred, we can log in to the OBC and run it::

    $ ssh kubos@10.0.2.20
    kubos@10.0.2.20's password: ********
    /home/kubos # python hello_world.py
    Hello, World!

Next Steps
----------

In the :doc:`next tutorial <first-mission-app>`, we'll create and run our first mission application.
