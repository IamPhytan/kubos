New User Tutorials
==================

Kubos users develop custom flight software for their OBCs using the :doc:`Kubos SDK <../sdk-docs/index>`.

This custom software is then used to communicate with the various :doc:`core <../services/core-services>` and
:doc:`hardware <../services/hardware-services>` services in order to interact with the system and execute
mission logic.

This series of tutorials will walk a new user through the major steps required to program a mission and then communicate with
a system once it is in-flight.

Mission Development Tutorials
-----------------------------

After the completion of these tutorials, the user will have created a mission application capable of querying their hardware for telemetry
data and then storing that data into the telemetry database.

    Creating Your First Mission Application <first-mission-app>
    
System Interaction Tutorials
----------------------------

These tutorials cover all of the ways a user might directly interact with a system from the ground.

There is no coding required for these actions, however some scripting may used for example purposes.
