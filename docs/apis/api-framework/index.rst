API Frameworks
==============

These documents are frameworks for developing APIs to integrate new hardware into the KubOS system. Each major component has a high level API framework to keep the interface as similar as possible and allow the hardware services to stay standardized between different vendor's components. These high level API call out the most frequently used capabilities of each of these types of systems, while still providing a catch-all for any unit-specific capabilities. 

The API categories are:

- :doc:`General Hardware <general-hardware>`
- Radio (upcoming)
- EPS (upcoming)
- Battery (upcoming)
- ADCS (upcoming)
- GPS (upcoming)
- RTC (upcoming)
